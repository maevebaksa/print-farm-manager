# Database

## Purpose

`server/db.js` manages the SQLite database. It opens the connection, sets pragmas, and runs `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables on every startup. New columns on existing installs are added via `ALTER TABLE` migrations wrapped in `try/catch` — SQLite throws if the column already exists, which is silently ignored.

On startup, `db.js` also runs one-time idempotent data migrations: seeding `printer_models` from existing printer/gcode records, and backfilling `printer_events` decommission entries for printers that were decommissioned before the events table existed.

## Driver

`better-sqlite3` — synchronous SQLite. All queries are blocking calls that return results directly (no promises, no callbacks). This simplifies the entire server-side codebase: no `async/await` is needed for database operations.

Pragmas set at startup:
- `journal_mode = WAL` — improves concurrent read performance
- `foreign_keys = ON` — enforces referential integrity on all FK relationships

## Tables

### printers

Stores the physical printer registry imported from the CSV spreadsheet.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS printers (
  id                  INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name                TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,      -- e.g. "MK4S_07", "Twilight"
  ip                  TEXT NOT NULL,             -- IP or hostname, e.g. "192.168.1.100" or "octoprint.lan"
  api_key             TEXT NOT NULL,             -- PrusaLink X-Api-Key header value
  group_name          TEXT,                      -- e.g. "MK4S Farm" (optional)
  type                TEXT DEFAULT 'prusa',      -- vendor; reserved for future use
  model               TEXT NOT NULL,             -- mk4 | mk4s | c1 | c1l | xl
  status              TEXT DEFAULT 'UNKNOWN',    -- live PrusaLink state
  is_held             INTEGER DEFAULT 1,         -- 1 = will not receive dispatch
  is_active           INTEGER DEFAULT 1,         -- 0 = decommissioned; skipped by poller
  decommissioned_at   INTEGER,                   -- epoch ms; set on decommission
  decommission_note   TEXT,                      -- optional operator note
  job_name            TEXT,                      -- filename of current print job (PRINTING only)
  job_progress        REAL,                      -- 0–100 from PrusaLink (PRINTING only)
  job_time_remaining  INTEGER,                   -- seconds remaining (PRINTING only)
  created_at          INTEGER NOT NULL           -- Unix epoch ms
);
```

The `job_name`, `job_progress`, and `job_time_remaining` columns are written on every poll cycle while `status = 'PRINTING'` and cleared to NULL the moment the printer leaves that state. `job_name` is sourced from our own `jobs`/`gcodes` tables (PrusaLink does not return a filename in its status response).

**Model resolution:** The `model` column in the CSV is the preferred source. Accepted values (case-insensitive): `MK4`, `MK4S`, `C1`, `C1L`, `XL`. These are normalized to lowercase as the internal ID.

If the `model` column is absent or blank, the import falls back to name-based inference:
- `MK4S_*` → `mk4s`
- `MK4_*` → `mk4`
- `Core1L_*`, `C1L *` → `c1l`
- `CoreOne_*`, `Core1_*`, `C1 *` → `c1`
- `XL_*` → `xl`
- No match → row is flagged; operator must resolve manually

If a `model` column is present, name inference is skipped entirely — any printer name is valid.

**`auto_advance`** (`INTEGER DEFAULT 0`, migration): for belt/conveyor printers that clear a finished plate themselves. When set, `scheduler.js`'s `_handleFinished` skips the usual hold-for-operator-confirmation step on a clean `FINISHED` transition and dispatches the next job immediately; `completed_qty` crediting itself is unaffected, only whether the printer stops for a human afterward. A genuine fault (`ERROR`), an operator-initiated stop (`STOPPED`), or a network drop (`OFFLINE`) always still holds the printer regardless of this flag. Toggled per printer from the printer detail view (`/printers/:id`) or the Settings Add Printer form; not importable via CSV.

**`camera_uid`** (`TEXT`, migration): selects which webcam `GET /api/printers/:id/camera` uses, for a Klipper printer whose crowsnest setup registers more than one (matched against Moonraker's own `uid` field for each webcam entry; see `server/drivers/klipper.js`'s `listCameras`). `null` (the default) falls back to the first enabled webcam, the previous behavior. Ignored by connectors that never report more than one camera.

**`camera_rotation`**, **`camera_flip_h`**, **`camera_flip_v`** (`INTEGER DEFAULT 0`, migration): display-only preferences applied as a client-side CSS transform wherever a camera image renders (the printer detail camera card, the Dashboard fleet grid's hover preview, the Webcams page). Not read from or written to the printer's own connector: this is purely how the farm app displays a feed it already has, independent of whatever a printer's own webcam server thinks its orientation is. `camera_rotation` is degrees (`0`/`90`/`180`/`270`); the flip flags are booleans. A 90/270 rotation is also compensated for in layout, not just repainted: see `client/src/cameraTransform.js`'s `rotationFitTransform`.

**`octoeverywhere_url`** (`TEXT`, migration): optional operator-supplied [OctoEverywhere](https://octoeverywhere.com) URL, generated per-printer in OctoEverywhere's own dashboard (this app has no way to look it up). When set, it replaces `http://<ip>` in the "open web interface" links on Fleet and the Dashboard fleet grid, so the link still works off the local network. Purely a link choice: OctoEverywhere is a remote-access proxy in front of an existing OctoPrint or Moonraker/Klipper web UI, not a printer connector, so this column has no effect on polling, dispatch, or any driver.

### printer_lanes

Per-toolhead filament state for a multi-lane Klipper printer, synced automatically from the [klipper-filament-sync](https://github.com/maevebaksa/klipper-filament-sync) plugin's Moonraker database entries (namespace `lane_data`, keyed `tool0`/`tool1`/...) on every poll cycle. `server/drivers/klipper.js`'s `getLaneData` reads the plugin's data; `server/poller.js`'s `_syncLanes` upserts it here and deletes any lane no longer reported, so this table always mirrors exactly what the plugin last said, never a superset that accumulates stale rows.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS printer_lanes (
  id          INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  printer_id  INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES printers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  lane_index  INTEGER NOT NULL,
  material    TEXT,
  color       TEXT,
  updated_at  INTEGER NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE(printer_id, lane_index)
);
```

Live state, not history, unlike `printer_events`: `ON DELETE CASCADE` because a deleted printer's lanes have no meaning to keep around. A printer with lanes is eligible for a G-code if *any single lane* satisfies its `required_material`/`required_color` together, in addition to (not instead of) the existing `loaded_material`/`loaded_color` check: see `server/scheduler.js`'s candidate query and its mirror at `GET /api/parts/:id/dispatch-status` (`server/routes/parts.js`). Checked per-lane deliberately: a printer with PLA in one lane and Black in a different lane must not match a request for "PLA and Black" just because both values exist somewhere on it. A printer without the plugin, or without lanes for any other reason, keeps working exactly as before: this table only ever adds eligibility, never removes any.

### printer_groups

A persisted registry of group names, independent of which printers currently carry a given `group_name`. `printers.group_name` stays plain free text (matched by string equality, not a foreign key), so nothing else in the schema changes: this table exists purely so a group used to restrict dispatch (see `gcodes.allowed_groups` / `projects.allowed_groups` below) can never silently disappear from every picker just because every printer that carried it was reassigned elsewhere.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS printer_groups (
  name        TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at  INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

Populated two ways: automatically, whenever a non-empty `group_name` is written on a printer (create, update, bulk-edit, or CSV import) that isn't already registered; or explicitly, via Settings → Groups. Deleting a group (`DELETE /api/groups/:name`) is blocked while any active printer, G-code, or project still references it.

### projects

Top-level organizational unit for a production run.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS projects (
  id                INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name              TEXT NOT NULL,
  description       TEXT,
  status            TEXT DEFAULT 'draft',   -- draft | active | paused | completed
  priority          INTEGER DEFAULT 0,      -- reserved for Phase 2 priority ordering
  required_material TEXT,                   -- optional project-wide default; gcode-level overrides
  required_color    TEXT,                   -- optional project-wide default; gcode-level overrides
  allowed_groups    TEXT,                   -- nullable JSON array; optional project-wide default; gcode-level overrides
  created_at        INTEGER NOT NULL,
  updated_at        INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

### parts

A distinct physical component within a project. Tracks production quantity progress.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS parts (
  id                  INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  project_id          INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id),
  name                TEXT NOT NULL,
  target_qty          INTEGER NOT NULL,
  completed_qty       INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  status              TEXT DEFAULT 'open',   -- open | closed
  sort_order          INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  print_time_seconds  INTEGER,               -- legacy; superseded by gcodes.est_print_secs
  material_grams      REAL,                  -- legacy; superseded by gcodes.material_grams
  created_at          INTEGER NOT NULL,
  updated_at          INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

A Part is **open** while `completed_qty < target_qty`. It transitions to **closed** automatically when `completed_qty >= target_qty`. `completed_qty` is allowed to exceed `target_qty` (expected due to plate-based printing — never dispatch half a plate).

`sort_order` controls dispatch priority within a project — the scheduler picks the lowest `sort_order` part first. Set via `PUT /api/parts/reorder`. New parts default to `0` and fall back to `created_at` as a tiebreaker.

`print_time_seconds` and `material_grams` on parts are legacy columns retained for schema compatibility but no longer written to. Time and material estimates are now stored per-gcode (see below) so they can vary by printer model.

### gcodes

A G-code file attached to a specific Part + printer model combination.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS gcodes (
  id                 INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  part_id            INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES parts(id),
  printer_model      TEXT NOT NULL,      -- mk4s | core1 | core1l | xl
  filename           TEXT NOT NULL,
  filepath           TEXT NOT NULL,      -- absolute path under server/gcode/
  parts_per_plate    INTEGER NOT NULL,
  est_print_secs     INTEGER,            -- nullable; per-plate print time in seconds
  material_grams     REAL,              -- nullable; per-plate filament weight in grams
  ams_slot           INTEGER,            -- Bambu only: -1=external spool, 0-N=AMS slot, NULL=non-Bambu
  allowed_groups     TEXT,               -- nullable JSON array e.g. '["Rack A","Rack B"]'; NULL = no restriction
  required_material  TEXT,               -- nullable; overrides the project default below when set
  required_color     TEXT,               -- nullable; overrides the project default below when set
  approved           INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,  -- 0 if the uploader requires print approval; see below
  created_at         INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

**Uniqueness on `(part_id, printer_model)`** is enforced at the application layer, not as a DB constraint, so the error message shown to the operator is clear and specific.

**`approved`:** 1 for every G-code except one uploaded by an account with `users.requires_print_approval = 1`, which starts at 0 (`POST /api/gcodes/upload`, see below). The scheduler's dispatch candidate query and `GET /api/parts/:id/dispatch-status` both check `approved = 1`: an unapproved G-code is simply never a dispatch candidate, the same mechanism as one with no matching printer, not a new hold/job state. `POST /api/gcodes/:id/approve` (admin-or-operator) clears it back to 1.

`est_print_secs` and `material_grams` are **per-plate** values (i.e., covering all parts on one plate, not one part). They are auto-populated from the filename on upload when the Bambu-style naming convention is detected, and can be edited later via `PUT /api/gcodes/:id`. Since each gcode belongs to one `printer_model`, the stats system can break down elapsed time and material used by model across a project's completed jobs.

**Targeting cascade (`allowed_groups`, `required_material`, `required_color`):** all three follow the same gcode-overrides-project pattern. The scheduler's dispatch candidate query and the `GET /api/parts/:id/dispatch-status` diagnostic both evaluate `COALESCE(gcodes.X, projects.X)`: a value set on the gcode always wins; otherwise the project's default (if any) applies; if neither is set, the field is unrestricted. `allowed_groups` differs from the material/color pair only in shape: it is a JSON array (a gcode or project can allow multiple groups), matched with `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM json_each(...) WHERE value = ?)` against the candidate printer's `group_name`, instead of a scalar equality check.

### jobs

A single print instance — one G-code file sent to one printer, one time.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS jobs (
  id               INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  part_id          INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES parts(id),
  printer_id       INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES printers(id),
  gcode_id         INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES gcodes(id),
  parts_per_plate  INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- snapshot of gcode.parts_per_plate at dispatch time
  status           TEXT DEFAULT 'queued',
                   -- queued | uploading | printing | finished | failed | cancelled
  started_at       INTEGER,
  finished_at      INTEGER,
  created_at       INTEGER NOT NULL,
  upload_first_failed_at INTEGER  -- migration; see below
);
```

`parts_per_plate` is snapshotted at dispatch time so changing the G-code record after dispatch doesn't retroactively affect in-flight jobs.

`upload_first_failed_at` is set the first time a job's upload exhausts its immediate in-call retries in `scheduler.js`'s `_executeUpload`, and never overwritten after that. While it is set and the job is still `uploading` (printer not held), the operator-configurable `upload_retry_window_min` setting (default 15, see [docs/api.md](api.md)) governs how much longer the scheduler keeps retrying the same job on later sweeps (`_retryPendingUploads`, triggered by `poller.js`'s `pollComplete` event every ~15s) before finally holding the printer for operator confirmation. `NULL` for a job whose upload never failed, or that has not been dispatched yet.

### printer_events

Permanent audit log for each printer. Events are never deleted and survive printer deletion (no FK constraint on `printer_id`).

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS printer_events (
  id          INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  printer_id  INTEGER NOT NULL,   -- no FK — history survives printer deletion
  event_type  TEXT NOT NULL,      -- decommission | recommission | job_finished | job_failed | confirmed | note
  note        TEXT,               -- human-readable detail; null for recommission/confirmed
  created_at  INTEGER NOT NULL,
  user_id     INTEGER,            -- migration; no FK, see below
  user_name   TEXT                -- migration; snapshot, not joined at read time
);
```

**Event types and when they are written:**

| `event_type` | Written by | Note content |
|---|---|---|
| `job_finished` | `scheduler.js` `_handleFinished` | `"Job N — Part Name (M parts)"` |
| `job_failed` | `printers.js` `mark-job-failure` | Job ID + part name, or `"No tracked job"` |
| `decommission` | `printers.js` decommission route(s) | Operator's decommission note (if any) |
| `recommission` | `index.js` recommission route | Operator's note (if any) |
| `confirmed` | `index.js` set-ready / set-ready-batch routes | `null`: the operator's sign-off action itself, `job_finished` already recorded what the hardware did |
| `info_changed` | `printers.js` `PUT /:id` | One row per changed field, `"Label: old → new"` |
| `note` | Events route (`POST /api/printers/:id/events`) | Operator-entered text |

**Backfill migration:** on first server start after this table was introduced, any printer with `is_active = 0` and `decommissioned_at` set automatically receives a synthetic `decommission` event using the stored timestamp and note — idempotent across restarts.

**`user_id`/`user_name`** (migration): which signed-in user performed an operator-triggered event (everything in the table above except the scheduler's own automatic `job_finished`/`offline_with_job`/`recovered`/`job_cancelled`, which stay attributed to nobody: a system transition, not an operator action). No FK on `user_id`, and `user_name` is a snapshot taken at insert time rather than joined at read time: this table's existing "history survives" guarantee (no FK on `printer_id` either) extends to a user being renamed or deleted later too. `server/events.js`'s `insert(printerId, eventType, note, user)` takes the acting `req.user` (or an equivalent `{id, name}`) as its optional fourth argument; omitted (or `null`) means a system-generated event. Both columns are `null` on any event written before this migration ran.

### users

One row per account. `password_hash` is null for an OIDC-only account (never set a local password); `oidc_subject` is null until that user's identity is linked to an SSO provider. See [docs/auth.md](auth.md) for the full auth model.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id            INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  email         TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  name          TEXT NOT NULL,
  password_hash TEXT,                       -- bcrypt hash; null for OIDC-only accounts
  role          TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'operator',  -- admin | operator
  oidc_subject  TEXT UNIQUE,                -- IdP's "sub" claim once SSO-linked; null otherwise
  created_at    INTEGER NOT NULL,
  last_login_at INTEGER
);
```

### sessions

A logged-in browser session. The `token` itself is the opaque value stored in the `pfm_session` httpOnly cookie; the row is looked up on every authenticated request rather than trusting a signed/stateless token, so revoking a session (logout, user deletion) takes effect immediately.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sessions (
  token       TEXT PRIMARY KEY,             -- random 32-byte hex, doubles as the cookie value
  user_id     INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at  INTEGER NOT NULL,
  expires_at  INTEGER NOT NULL              -- created_at + 30 days
);
```

### api_keys

A long-lived credential that authenticates as its owning user (full access, not scoped) via `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. Same never-store-the-secret pattern as `users.password_hash`: only `key_hash` (bcrypt) is persisted. `key_prefix` is the first 12 characters of the plaintext, kept so the Settings UI can show "pfm_ab12cd34..." without ever displaying the full key again after creation.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS api_keys (
  id            INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  user_id       INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  name          TEXT NOT NULL,              -- operator-chosen label, e.g. "OrcaSlicer"
  key_prefix    TEXT NOT NULL,              -- "pfm_" + 8 hex chars, for display only
  key_hash      TEXT NOT NULL,              -- bcrypt hash of the full key; plaintext is never stored
  created_at    INTEGER NOT NULL,
  last_used_at  INTEGER,
  revoked_at    INTEGER                     -- soft delete; null while active
);
```

## Conventions

- All IDs: `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`
- All timestamps: Unix epoch milliseconds (`INTEGER`) — use `Date.now()` in application code
- Booleans: `INTEGER` with values `0` (false) and `1` (true)
- All queries use `?` positional parameters — no string interpolation
- `COALESCE(?, column)` pattern used for partial updates (PUT endpoints) so omitting a field leaves the existing value intact

## File Locations

- Database: `server/data/farm.db` (gitignored)
- G-code storage: `server/gcode/` (gitignored)

Both directories are created automatically on first startup if they don't exist.
